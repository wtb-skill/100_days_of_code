cookie.py works, plays the game for x (10) secs then gives a report and closes <br />
I would like to play the game multiple times (by automation) to check what strategy (by changing the ratio variable) works best (via the report - money left, cookies per second and current ratio) 
but the issue arises after the first instance of the game. <br />
